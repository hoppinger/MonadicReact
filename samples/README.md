# Samples Demo

To run the Sample application you will first need to install all dependencies. All commands listed below will be run from the repo's root directory.

```
yarn install
```

Next compile the stylesheets as well as bundle the client:

```
yarn css
yarn fe
```

The `fe` script starts a watcher, so open a new terminal to start the server.

```
yarn be
```

The samples can now be viewed at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
